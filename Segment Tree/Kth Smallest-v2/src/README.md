This Java code implements a persistent segment tree for answering k-th smallest element queries within a range of an array. Persistent segment trees are advanced data structures that efficiently handle queries on immutable versions of data, allowing access to any version of the data at any time without modifying it. Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities of the code:

1. **Node Class**: Represents a node in the segment tree. Each node keeps track of the count of elements in its range and has pointers to its left and right children. The `insert` method is used to update the tree when inserting an element, creating a new path in the tree for every update and thus making the tree persistent.

2. **SegmentTree Class**: Manages the construction and queries on the segment tree. It uses a map to compress the values of the array (since segment trees require 0-based indexing), a sorted array to keep track of the unique elements, and an array of nodes to represent each version of the segment tree after each insertion.

    - **build**: Initializes the segment tree by inserting each element of the input array into the persistent segment tree, effectively creating a new version of the tree for each element inserted.
    
    - **KthSmallest**: Public method that handles queries for the k-th smallest element within a specified range. It delegates the actual query to a private method `kthSmallest`.

    - **kthSmallest**: A recursive function that navigates through the segment tree to find the k-th smallest element between two versions of the tree (which effectively represent the cumulative state of the tree between two indices).

3. **Main Class (Q4)**: Handles input and output. It reads the array and queries from standard input, prepares the data by sorting the array and mapping the elements to their indices in the sorted array, then constructs the segment tree and processes each query by outputting the k-th smallest element in the given range.

Key Operations:
- **Compression**: The input values are compressed using a map to ensure the segment tree can efficiently handle large values by mapping them to a smaller range.
- **Persistence**: Achieved by ensuring that updates to the tree (insertions) do not overwrite existing nodes but instead create new nodes as needed, thus preserving the history of insertions.
- **Binary Search**: The process of finding the k-th smallest element uses a binary search approach, dividing the range and counting elements to navigate the tree.

This implementation is particularly useful for scenarios where it's necessary to make repeated queries for statistics (like the k-th smallest element) within different ranges of an array, without modifying the underlying data. It showcases the power of persistent data structures for solving complex problems efficiently.
