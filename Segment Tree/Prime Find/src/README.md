This Java code introduces a 2D Segment Tree, a powerful data structure optimized for querying 2D data like matrices. Specifically, it's designed to find the minimum and maximum prime numbers within any submatrix and to update elements within the matrix. The code consists of two main classes: `Node` and `SegmentTree`, along with a driver class to handle input and execute queries.

### Node Class
The `Node` class models each node in the segment tree, storing the minimum and maximum prime numbers within the node's range. If there are no prime numbers, it initializes `minPrime` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `maxPrime` to `Integer.MIN_VALUE` to facilitate comparison operations.

### SegmentTree Class
The `SegmentTree` class constructs a 2D segment tree from a given 2D array. It features methods for building the tree, updating an element, and querying for the minimum and maximum prime numbers within a specified submatrix. 

- **Building the Tree**: The tree is built in two dimensions. `build_x` constructs the segment tree for the rows, and `build_y` further builds trees for the columns within each row segment, creating a 2D structure.
- **Updating Elements**: The `update_x` and `update_y` methods allow modifications to elements within the matrix, adjusting both the tree structure and the stored prime information accordingly.
- **Querying**: The `getMin_x`, `getMin_y`, `getMax_x`, and `getMax_y` methods support queries for the smallest and largest prime numbers within any given submatrix, using recursive tree traversal.

### Main Class (Q5)
The main class demonstrates how to use the `SegmentTree` for processing queries. It reads a matrix of integers and a series of queries from the standard input. Queries can either update a matrix element or request the smallest or largest prime number within a submatrix. The output for each query is either the prime number found or a message indicating no primes were found.

### Highlights and Use Cases
- **Prime Number Identification**: The code identifies prime numbers using the `isPrime` method within the `SegmentTree` class. This method is crucial for ensuring that only prime numbers are considered during the build and query processes.
- **Efficient 2D Queries**: By using a 2D segment tree, the code efficiently handles dynamic queries on 2D data, which is particularly useful in image processing, computational geometry, and other areas requiring rapid aggregation and update operations on matrices.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The ability to update matrix elements and maintain accurate query responses in logarithmic time makes this structure highly suited for interactive or real-time applications where the underlying data changes frequently.

This implementation demonstrates a sophisticated use of segment trees for 2D data, showcasing their utility in efficiently solving complex range query problems.
